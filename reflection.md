# PawPal+ Project Reflection

## 1. System Design

**a. Initial design**

- Briefly describe your initial UML design.
- What classes did you include, and what responsibilities did you assign to each?

Core user actions:

1. The user can add and manage their pet’s information.
2. The user can create and manage pet care tasks (feeding, walking, medication, etc.).
3. The user can generate and view a daily schedule based on task priority and available time.

I designed four main classes: Owner, Pet, Task, and Scheduler.

The Owner class represents the user and manages their pets.
The Pet class represents individual pets and stores their associated tasks.
The Task class represents pet care activities with attributes like duration, priority, and completion status.
The Scheduler class is responsible for organizing tasks into a daily plan based on available time and priority.

This design separates responsibilities clearly and allows scheduling logic to be handled independently.

**b. Design changes**

- Did your design change during implementation?
- If yes, describe at least one change and why you made it.

---I simplified my initial UML design by removing unnecessary methods and focusing on core functionality.
I also refined method names to better reflect their responsibilities, such as using generate_schedule instead of organize_tasks.
These changes made the system more modular and easier to implement.

## 2. Scheduling Logic and Tradeoffs

**a. Constraints and priorities**

- What constraints does your scheduler consider (for example: time, priority, preferences)?
- How did you decide which constraints mattered most?

**b. Tradeoffs**

- Describe one tradeoff your scheduler makes.
- Why is that tradeoff reasonable for this scenario?

## 3. AI Collaboration

**a. How you used AI**

- How did you use AI tools during this project (for example: design brainstorming, debugging, refactoring)?
- What kinds of prompts or questions were most helpful?

**b. Judgment and verification**

- Describe one moment where you did not accept an AI suggestion as-is.
- How did you evaluate or verify what the AI suggested?

---

## 4. Testing and Verification

**a. What you tested**

- What behaviors did you test?
- Why were these tests important?

**b. Confidence**

- How confident are you that your scheduler works correctly?
- What edge cases would you test next if you had more time?

## 5. Reflection

**a. What went well**

- What part of this project are you most satisfied with?

**b. What you would improve**

- If you had another iteration, what would you improve or redesign?

**c. Key takeaway**

- What is one important thing you learned about designing systems or working with AI on this project?
